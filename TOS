Radio Global Terms of Service
Last Updated: 17/06/23
Proper Usage
Radio Global plays only things listed in the /list command that can be found on the bot. You may use these commands as you would like within your server as long as what you are doing does not break discord's TOS.

Radio Global stores guildIDs and userIDs. We will ONLY store said IDs if the bot requires it to complete actions within your server. If you would like to delete your data, disable the systems that store it. You can also join our support server to request personal data deletion.
